When buying or selling property in Florida, most people expect a smooth transaction. But sometimes, issues hidden in a property's history can cause unexpected delays. These are called **title issues**, and they can turn your closing into a stressful experience if not resolved quickly.

At Title 27, LLC, we help clients across **Doral, Miami, and all of Miami-Dade** navigate these problems efficiently so you can close with confidence.

## 1. Liens on the Property

A lien is a legal claim on the property due to unpaid debts—this could be from contractors, taxes, or even homeowners’ associations. If not caught early, it can delay or block the sale.

**Example**: A previous owner failed to pay a roofing company. The company placed a lien on the home. Without resolving it, the title cannot transfer.

## 2. Unknown Heirs or Ownership Disputes

If a property was inherited, there may be unknown or disputed heirs who still have a legal claim. This is common in Miami-Dade, where generational property is passed down without formal probate.

## 3. Errors in Public Records

A simple typo in a deed, incorrect legal description, or outdated notary seal can make a title "unmarketable"—which means it can’t legally be sold until corrected.

## 4. Forgery or Fraud

In rare cases, forged documents or fraudulent transfers can appear in the property’s history. Title insurance protects you against this, but it can still delay the closing.

## 5. Unreleased Mortgages

Sometimes, old loans appear on record as unpaid even when they’ve been satisfied. This happens when the lender forgets to file a satisfaction of mortgage. It must be cleared before closing.
